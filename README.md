# mangas-project
A project for studying purposes, using React, TypeScript, MaterialUI, Firebase and other libs.

The idea of this project is to create a Manga List, where users can add which manga they are currently reading/finished reading/have interest on reading to their account, and be able to search if there's new chapters released for them.

Also, there'll be an admin panel where admins can add new mangas to the database.
