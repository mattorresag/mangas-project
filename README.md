# mangas-project
A project for studying purposes, using Vite, React, TypeScript, MaterialUI, Firebase and other libs.

I've also used React-Context in order to keep states amongst all components, and breakpoints in order to make it responsive and work just fine in mobile devices.

The idea of this project is to create a Manga List, where users can add which manga they are currently reading/finished reading/have interest on reading to their account, and be able to search if there's new chapters released for them. As I myself am not able to keep track of all the Mangas I'm currently reading, I created this in order to help.
