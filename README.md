# mangas-project
A project for studying purposes, using Vite, React, TypeScript, MaterialUI, Firebase and other libs.

The idea of this project is to create a Manga List, where users can add which manga they are currently reading/finished reading/have interest on reading to their account, and be able to search if there's new chapters released for them. As I myself am not able to keep track of all the Mangas I'm currently reading, I created this in order to help.
